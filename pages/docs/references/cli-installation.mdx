<summary>Windows Installations</summary>

Our Windows CLI requires [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). We do not support WSL 1. To verify your WSL version you can run the following from your Command shell or PowerShell: 

```sh
wsl -l -v
```

If you need to install or upgrade your WSL version please [follow these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2). \

Once you have confirmed your WSL version, please open the Linux shell and run the following command: 

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.devzero.io | sh
```
