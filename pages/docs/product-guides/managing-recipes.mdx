    UI. Your teammates will not be able to see or launch workspaces from recipes that are private to
    you.

    Generally speaking, an engineering team should be able to share a common set of recipes.
    Developer-specific customizations and preferences are only applied at launch time, meaning that
    everyone can rely on the same shared environment definition and still get a workspace that feels
    like their local, personalized development environment.{' '}

    Recipes can be edited by two groups - anyone with an admin role, and the owner/creator of a
    recipe.{' '}

    All attributes of a recipe can be edited after initial creation. This can be done within the web
    UI using the edit recipe function.{' '}
