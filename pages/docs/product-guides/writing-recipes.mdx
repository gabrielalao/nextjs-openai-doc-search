<h1>Writing Recipes</h1>
<p>
  Recipe templates can currently created using our Web UI only. There is currently no way to edit
  the underlying YAML template, although we plan to make this feature accessible to power users
  soon!
  <br />
  <br />
  To start creating a new recipe, use the New Recipe button in the top-right corner of your screen. You
  can also leverage our Quickstart example recipes which can be found in the Shared Recipe Library.
