<h1>Create Your First Recipe</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/new/repo">recipe</a> can be thought of as a template for a given environment. This could be an environment for development, testing, QA, or anything you need!</p>
<p>All workspaces are launched from a recipe template, so to start using the platform, you'll need to create a recipe. We offer a few Quickstart examples for common stacks and use cases, which should be visible in your shared recipe library on the web console. Alternatively, you can create a custom recipe to meet your needs better. </p>
<p>Recipes allow you to automate and control all build and runtime steps for your environment. This includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Default region(s) where the environment should be deployed</li>
<li>Minimum compute resources required to run the environment</li>
<li>Cloning code repositories</li>
<li>Installing host or application packages and dependencies</li>
<li>Executing arbitrary bash commands and scripts</li>
<li>Networking to shared cloud or 3rd party resources</li>
</ul>
<p>The recipe creation process begins by denoting the required code bases for a given environment. We can currently import any public or private GitHub repositories. To work with private repositories, please follow the onscreen guidance to install and authorize our GitHub app. </p>
<p>All other recipe customizations are guided by the web UI. </p>
<p>To create a new Recipe, select "Create New" from the top-right navbar at devzero.io/dashboard and select "Create New Recipe"</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> be sure to provide a helpful recipe name to make it easy for your teammates to understand how and when to use workspaces based on that recipe. </p>
