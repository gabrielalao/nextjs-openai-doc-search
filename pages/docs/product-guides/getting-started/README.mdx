<summary><strong>Step 2:</strong> Connect your Remote Code Provider</summary>

We currently only support GitHub as a code provider for DevZero workspaces. BitBucket and GitLab support are coming soon! \

If you only plan to work with Public Repositories, you do not need to enable our GitHub integration. However, if you'd like to work with private repositories from within a DevZero workspace you'll need to head to [https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/settings/personal#git-providers](https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/settings/personal#git-providers) and complete the installation steps.&#x20;
