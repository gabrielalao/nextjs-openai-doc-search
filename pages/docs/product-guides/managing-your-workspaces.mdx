<h1>Managing Your Workspaces</h1>
<p>
  Once launched, workspaces remain active so long as there is an active SSH connection or activity
  occurring within that workspace. After a prolonged period of inactivity, a workspace may be put in
  hibernation. This is fully stateful and will only add a few seconds to the relaunch time when
  reassuming that workspace.
</p>
<p>Your workspace lifecycle should look something like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    I need to start some new development work so I launch a workspace from the relevant environment
    recipe.
  </li>
  <li>I connect to that workspace and write some code.</li>
  <li>Once that work has been complete, I delete the workspace.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Generally speaking, workspaces are meant to be ephemeral and not long lived, as you can always
  spin up a fresh workspace in <code>&#x3C;</code>1 minute. However, you can rest assured that until
  you choose to manually delete your workspace(s), any changes and state will always be preserved.
